                        Pancakebot: An over-the-top fully automated crêpe maker.
                    </h1>
                </p>
                Sometimes, the simplest problems requires the most over-engineered, complicated and ridicoulus solutions. Pancakebot is one of those.
                It all started as a mechatronics project on DTU with a couple of fellow students (Frederik, Emilie, Sofie, Lasse and Ditte for credits).
                We were all incredibly dissatisfied with the time-consuming and boring process of baking crêpes, and decided to do something radical about it.
                After 3 intense weeks of staying up late, coding, cutting and gluing, we saw the fruits of our hard work: <i>Pancakebot</i>:

                </div>
                <p>
                    <h3>Actuator frenzy!</h3>
                    Pancakebot contains no less than 10 actuators and sensors, making this project oversize, overkill and almost impossible to finish in 3 weeks. Heres a complete list:

                    <ul>
                        <li>An ultrasonic distance sensor for measuring the amount of pancake dough left in the container</li>
                        <li>A 230V relay for toggling the pancake heater</li>
                        <li>A peristaltic pump for dispensing dough for each pancake</li>
                        <li>A crane for opening and closing the pancake heater lid (yes you read that right, a custom built crane with two servos)</li>
                        <li>A linear actuator for pushing of the pancake when it's done (not even that ridiculous, our initial idea was a fan for blowing it off)</li>
                        <li>A screen with buttons to order any amount of pancakes, with feedback if one of the sensors screws up.</li>
                        <li>A physical arrow with numbers, indicating the progress of pancake cooking.</li>
                        <li>A weight measuring if the pancake successfully landed on the serving plate.</li>
                        <li>A servo rotating the measurement cup for dough, tilting the dough into the heater.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Controller</h3>
                All these components were controlled by a single Arduino Mega, and oh my did we regret that. Connections didn't fix, the relay crashed and reset everything and we couldn't found our way in all the wires.
